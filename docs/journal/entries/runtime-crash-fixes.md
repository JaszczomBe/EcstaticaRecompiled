## 2026-07-13 - Title Logic Reached

Area: `FUN_00414998 -> FUN_0041760c -> FUN_00417b20`, startup logo blit and title transition

Symptom: after the visible-window milestone, execution crashed in DirectDraw/palette and startup blit code before reaching title logic.

Evidence: `FUN_0041af88` first called the DirectDraw palette creation slot at vtable offset `0x14`, but the existing stub only implemented `CreateSurface`, leaving `_DAT_006366c0` null. After palette creation was stubbed, the next crashes exposed generated overlap/register artifacts: palette out-pointer writes targeted `DAT_006366c0` while reads used `_DAT_006366c0`; `FUN_00418a04` lost incoming `EAX` as the buffer index; `FUN_00417b20` lost incoming `EBX` as a blit coordinate; and generated `DAT_00636150` table reads did not see the `_DAT_0063615x` buffer aliases.

Change: added a minimal DirectDraw palette object and `CreatePalette` stub, redirected palette out-pointer writes to `_DAT_006366c0`, recovered the `FUN_00418a04` index and `FUN_00417b20` coordinate for the startup blit path, mapped the legacy VGA `0xa0000..0x100000` range, and mirrored reconstructed-code repairs in `E2Recomp/tools/GenerateRecon.js`.

Result: `cmake --build --preset linux-clang32-debug` and `cmake --build build/linux-clang32-asan` both compile. GDB breakpoints hit `FUN_00414a94` and then `FUN_00414b24` from `FUN_00410a48`; the process exited with code `0340` instead of crashing in the DirectDraw/surface frontier.

Next Frontier: step 5 should continue from reached title logic toward the reconstructed main loop.

Regression Risk: DirectDraw behavior is still intentionally skeletal. Palette creation, surface methods, VGA mapping, and startup blit coordinate recovery are sufficient for this milestone but not accurate rendering.

## 2026-07-13 - Visible Window Path Proven

Area: `FUN_00458714 -> RegisterClassA -> CreateWindowExA`, initial Ecstatica II window creation

Symptom: after the first resource open was proven, execution could not advance to the window milestone because file descriptor/open-mode bookkeeping still read decompiler pseudo-registers and stale pointer-shaped values.

Evidence: original disassembly for `FUN_0045e5b8` shows the final stream-state call passes the descriptor in `EAX` and flags in `EDX`; the reconstructed code instead built an argument from `E2R_READ1(param_4,1)` with `param_4 == 0x200`. Original close helpers `FUN_0045e8e6` and `FUN_004608e8` likewise carry the descriptor in `EAX`. After repairing those paths, GDB reached `RegisterClassA` and `CreateWindowExA` from `FUN_00458714`; the top-level request used class `Ecstatica2`, title `Ecstatica II`, and size `640x640`.

Change: recovered descriptor registration/status/close bookkeeping around `FUN_004603d1`, `FUN_00460803`, `FUN_00460899`, `FUN_0045e5b8`, `FUN_0045e8e6`, and `FUN_004608e8`; mirrored those repairs in `E2Recomp/tools/GenerateRecon.js`. Added a minimal Linux X11 implementation behind `CreateWindowExA` so the original top-level window request maps a real host window.

Result: `cmake --build --preset linux-clang32-debug` and `cmake --build build/linux-clang32-asan` both compile. GDB showed `CreateWindowExA` returning the platform HWND and `e2r_x11_window.window == 20971521`, proving that the X11 window was created and mapped.

Next Frontier: after window creation, execution now crashes in `FUN_0041af88` at `E2Recomp_recon.c:8567`, calling through a DirectDraw/surface vtable during the startup logo path. The next step should recover enough DirectDraw surface behavior to reach menu/title logic.

Regression Risk: the file descriptor table repair allocates a fixed Win32-like handle table sized from `DAT_0047d610`. If later runtime paths require exact CRT descriptor growth semantics, replace it with a fuller reconstruction. The X11 window shim intentionally covers only top-level visibility, not complete Win32 message or rendering behavior.

## 2026-07-13 - First Resource Open Proven

Area: `FUN_00410a48 -> FUN_00414998 -> FUN_0045e594`, startup logo/config resource loading

Symptom: after the title-error pointer repair, tracing showed the first `CreateFileA` request was an empty string from `FUN_00414998`, so no real data file was opened.

Evidence: original disassembly for `FUN_00410a48` loads `EAX = 0x470510` before the first unconditional `FUN_00414998` call, which metadata names `s_psyglogo.raw_00470510`. Original `FUN_00414998` copies incoming `EAX` to `EDX` at entry and uses that preserved filename after `FUN_0043ac60`. GDB tracing after the repair shows `CreateFileA request: "psyglogo.raw"` and a valid non-`INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE` handle. The runtime is started from `build/linux-clang32-debug`, then enters the `Ecstatica2` data symlink before reconstructed startup.

Change: restored the lost `FUN_00414998` filename input from `param_1`, preserved it across `FUN_0043ac60`, recovered the three startup logo filename symbols used by `FUN_00410a48`, converted the split `E_CONFIG` stack filename into a contiguous 9-byte buffer, changed the Linux launcher to enter `E2RECOMP_DATA_DIR`, and made `CreateFileA` normalize backslashes plus resolve read-only paths case-insensitively. Mirrored generated-code repairs in `E2Recomp/tools/GenerateRecon.js`.

Result: `cmake --build --preset linux-clang32-debug` and `cmake --build build/linux-clang32-asan` both compile. The first proven real resource open is `/home/rgrabowski/Games/Ecstatica2/PSYGLOGO.RAW`, requested by reconstructed code as `psyglogo.raw`.

Next Frontier: after the successful open, debug GDB now stops in `FUN_0045e5b8` at `E2Recomp_recon.c:52844`, where the decompiled code reads `E2R_READ1(param_4,1)` with `param_4 == 0x200`. The next investigation should recover the file-handle/open-mode bookkeeping around `FUN_0045e5b8` instead of treating `param_4` as a pointer.

Regression Risk: the `CreateFileA` compatibility fallback is intentionally Win32-like for read-only opens; if write/create paths later need case handling, extend it carefully without redirecting writes to unintended files.

## 2026-07-13 - Title Error Exit Lost EAX Message Pointer

Area: `FUN_00414b24 -> FUN_00414e68`, title picture load failure path

Symptom: `FUN_00414e68` dereferenced `0x200` while scanning its shutdown message string.

Evidence: original disassembly shows `FUN_00414e68` saves `EAX` into `EBP` at entry and later scans that pointer. The failing `FUN_00414b24` branch at `00414e43` loads `EAX = 0x471320` before calling `00414e68`; metadata names that string `s_Can't_load_title_picture_00471320`. GDB stopped at the reconstructed `FUN_00414e68` with the stale local still showing `0x200` before the new assignment, then after one step `in_EAX` pointed at `s_Can_t_load_title_picture_00471320` with contents `Can't load title picture`.

Change: initialized the lost `in_EAX` pseudo-register in `FUN_00414e68` to the recovered title-load error string, added the missing generated string declaration/global/data initialization, and mirrored the function-body repair in `E2Recomp/tools/GenerateRecon.js`.

Result: `cmake --build --preset linux-clang32-debug` and `cmake --build build/linux-clang32-asan` both compile. Debug GDB run no longer faults on the `0x200` dereference; it exits through the recovered fatal shutdown path with code `0364`.

Next Frontier: the runtime now reaches a clean fatal exit for `Can't load title picture`, meaning the next startup investigation should focus on why `FUN_0045e594(..., s_title_s_raw_00471314, 0x200, ...)` fails to load `title_s.raw` from the Ecstatica II data path. ASan execution still aborts earlier in `FUN_0041dc8c` on a global-buffer-overflow around overlapping globals near `DAT_0047a2b4`; the ASan build itself compiles.

Regression Risk: `FUN_00414e68` is a shared fatal-exit helper whose original convention carries the message pointer in `EAX`. This repair recovers the current title-load call path only; future fatal-exit call sites may need their own `EAX` message recovery instead of reusing this default.

## 2026-07-13 - Startup Wait-Loop Stack Corruption

Area: `FUN_00410a48`, startup pacing around `FUN_00414998`

Symptom: after the date conversion helper repair, the program reached `FUN_0043ac60` and then crashed with `EIP=0x0`. The raw stack showed return addresses around `FUN_00410a48:570`, where startup wait loops called `FUN_0045f1c0` with decompiler `extraout_ECX` values.

Evidence: GDB showed the first `FUN_0043ac60` return had a sane frame, but the later crash involved a `FUN_0045f1c0` call with a stack/frame pointer-like output address. That helper writes a 0x24-byte time structure, so using a phantom register as the destination can overwrite caller stack state.

Change: replaced the fragile 5 ms busy-wait loops in `FUN_00410a48` with explicit `Sleep(5)` pacing and stable zero arguments for the adjacent calls. Mirrored the transformation in `E2Recomp/tools/GenerateRecon.js`.

Result: both `linux-clang32-debug` and `linux-clang32-asan` rebuilt. The runtime moved past the null instruction pointer crash and now stops in `FUN_00414e68` via `FUN_00414b24`, dereferencing `0x200`.

Regression Risk: this is a Linux runtime stabilization, not a perfect reconstruction of the original timing code. If menu/intro pacing behaves oddly later, recover the original local time-buffer addresses with Ghidra and replace the `Sleep(5)` shim.

## 2026-07-13 - Date Helper Lost Output Pointer

Area: `FUN_004645d2`, called from `FUN_00461ab5`/`FUN_0045f1c0`

Symptom: crash writing through `extraout_ECX_00 + 0x10` inside `FUN_004645d2`.

Evidence: GDB stopped at `E2Recomp_recon.c:60066`; the destination pointer resolved to unrelated executable memory rather than the time output structure.

Change: rewired `FUN_004645d2` to write year/month/day/week fields through `param_1` and to return `param_1`. Mirrored the replacement in `GenerateRecon.js`.

Result: the program advanced to the startup wait-loop stack corruption described above.

Regression Risk: `FUN_004645d2` still contains unrecovered `in_EAX`/`unaff_EBX` inputs. It may need a fuller Ghidra-backed signature recovery when date/time behavior matters.
